Repository of the current TIP APIs

TIP is an industry work group dedicated to promoting open interfaces to streamline advertising transactions for local TV broadcasters and their media agency partners. The consortium is formed of local television broadcasters including E.W. Scripps, Fox Television Stations, Graham Media Group, Gray Television, Hearst Television, NBC & Telemundo Owned Stations, Nexstar Media Group, Sinclair Broadcast Group, and TEGNA. 

The goal of TIP is to accelerate automation of spot television and to streamline transactions and reduce the reconciliation burdens on buyer and seller. TIP aims to foster interoperability between system providers to create the broadest access to local television supply and demand. The TVB, the trade association representing local broadcast television, provides a repository for the TIP Initiative’s work and open access for industry partners at TVB.org/TIP.
