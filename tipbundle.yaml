    | Alternate ID (AD ID) | A unique identifier for commercial copy assigned to most commercials by advertising agencies. |
    | Automated Ad Buying | Or programmatic, typically refers to the use of software to purchase digital advertising, as opposed to the traditional process that involves RFPs, human negotiations and manual insertion orders.

    | Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) | A communication technology used to transmit data from one system to another as a batch file exchange process. |
    | Estimate  | Reference code used in buying systems for reconciliation |
    | Equivalized | Units whose impressions are weighted down or up from 30-second impressions based on their ratio of their length to 30 seconds. For example, if a selling title has projected 30-second impressions of 50,000 for a particular demo, equivalized impressions for a 15-second unit would be 25,000 and for a 60-second unit would be 100,000. |
