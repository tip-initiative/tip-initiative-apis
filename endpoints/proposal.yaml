  title: Proposal
  description: |
    * Allows the seller to respond back to the buyer with the detailed proposal for a given RFP or revised proposal; 
    Multiple versions of a proposal can be under negotiation for the same campaign, but only one version may be executed; buyer must submit a 
    "Proposal Change Request" for the last proposal version submission; seller must respond back with a Proposal Response that contains a new 
    version number when submitting new versions. Â New Proposals may be submitted without a RFP Response
